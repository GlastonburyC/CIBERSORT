# Using CIBERSORT to estimate cell type composition.

We present computationally estimated cell type proportions from two seperate cohorts: TwinsUk & The Genotype Tissue Expression Consortium GTEx

Cell estimates for GTEx and TwinsUK can be found in:

```cohort_CellEstimates/```


Additionally, we provide all summary statistics for eQTL analysis adjusted for cell type proportions and GxCell interaction tests [available here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17eyKz1YWa8Ujb6Y0ELXSwqmm7fj99j1Q)
