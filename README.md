# Using CIBERSORT to estimate cell type composition.

We present computationally estimated cell type proportions from two seperate cohorts: `TwinsUK` & The Genotype Tissue Expression Consortium (`GTEx`).

Cell estimates for `GTEx` and `TwinsUK` can be found in:

```cohort_CellEstimates/```

Code, figures and files for simulations can be found in: 

```simulations/```

The signature matrix to use with `CIBERSORT` to perform the deconvolution can be found in:

```SignatureMatrix/```

Additionally, we provide all summary statistics for eQTL analysis adjusted for cell type proportions and `GxCell` interaction tests [available here.](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17eyKz1YWa8Ujb6Y0ELXSwqmm7fj99j1Q)
